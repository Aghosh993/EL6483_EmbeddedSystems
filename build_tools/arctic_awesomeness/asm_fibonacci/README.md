# Recitation/Demo 5: Fibonacci series on an STM32 F3 Discovery board in ARM Assembly

This example implements a Fibonacci series algorithm in ARM assembly on the STM32 F3 Discovery. No peripherals are being used that are specific to the F3 chip, so any Cortex-M4 processor should work with this example assuming you have the ability to correctly link the code against its memory layout.

(THIS EXAMPLE NOT CURRENTLY COMPLETE!!)
