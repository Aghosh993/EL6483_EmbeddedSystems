# EL6483_EmbeddedSystems

All course materials, build systems, etc. for the graduate Real-Time Embedded Systems Course, Spring 2017

## Build tools overview:

Within the "build_tools" directory, one can find the build systems for Windows (redmond_rodeo), Mac OS X (feisty_feline) and Linux (arctic_awesomeness). The Linux build system is the most mature from a testing perspective, but all three systems have tests run against them periodically on all machines I routinely can obtain access to. I always appreciate bug reports via the "Issues" tab on this repository.
